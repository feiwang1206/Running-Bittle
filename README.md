# Running-Bittle
This is a running gait for Bittle (https://github.com/PetoiCamp/OpenCat).
Please replace the two '*.h' files in folder 'OpenCat/src' and upload the new instincts skills.
Run the dog by clicking the '7' and 'CH+' button on the infrared remote controller.

The 'ang_running.m' is the matlab script for generating the running angles.
Good luck!
